# Technical Specification: OPS-49 - Product Catalog Operations Setup

**Revision Date:** December 2024  
**Ticket:** OPS-49  
**Project:** Product Catalog UI

## Executive Summary

This specification outlines the operational infrastructure and deployment strategy for the Product Catalog UI application. The current application is in early development stage with a basic React/TypeScript/Tailwind CSS setup using Bun runtime.

## Current State Analysis

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (2-3 days)

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# Proposed .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml structure
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  test:
    - Install dependencies with Bun
    - Run linting and type checking
    - Execute test suite
    - Generate coverage reports
  
  build:
    - Build application with production optimizations
    - Generate and upload build artifacts
    
  deploy-staging:
    - Deploy to staging environment on main branch
    - Run smoke tests
    
  deploy-production:
    - Deploy to production on release tags
    - Run comprehensive health checks
```

#### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Hosting:** Vercel or Netlify for static hosting (recommended for React apps)
- **Alternative:** AWS CloudFront + S3 for enterprise deployments
- **Database:** None currently required (static catalog)
- **CDN:** Automatic with Vercel/Netlify

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration (1-2 days)

#### Environment Variables
```typescript
// Proposed environment configuration
interface EnvironmentConfig {
  NODE_ENV: 'development' | 'staging' | 'production';
  API_BASE_URL: string;
  SENTRY_DSN?: string;
  ANALYTICS_ID?: string;
  FEATURE_FLAGS?: Record<string, boolean>;
}
```

#### Configuration Management
- Environment-specific `.env` files
- Runtime environment detection
- Feature flag system for gradual rollouts

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Observability (2-3 days)

#### Error Tracking
- **Tool:** Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Integration:** React Error Boundary components
- **Alerts:** Real-time notifications for critical errors

#### Performance Monitoring
- **Tool:** Web Vitals tracking with Google Analytics or custom solution
- **Metrics:** Core Web Vitals (CLS, FID, LCP)
- **Lighthouse CI:** Automated performance testing in CI/CD

#### Health Checks
- **Endpoint:** `/api/health` for application health monitoring
- **Monitoring:** Uptime monitoring with Pingdom or DataDog
- **Dashboards:** Grafana or similar for metrics visualization

### Phase 4: Security Hardening (1-2 days)

#### Security Headers
```typescript
// Proposed security headers configuration
{
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Permissions-Policy': 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()'
}
```

#### Dependency Security
- Automated dependency scanning with Dependabot
- Regular security audits with `bun audit`
- SAST scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Plan

### Sprint 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Day 1-2:** Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
2. **Day 3:** Configure staging environment deployment
3. **Day 4-5:** Set up production deployment with manual approval

### Sprint 2: Monitoring (Week 2)
1. **Day 1-2:** Integrate Sentry for error tracking
2. **Day 3:** Set up performance monitoring
3. **Day 4:** Configure uptime monitoring

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **External Dependencies:** Reliance on third-party services for hosting and monitoring
- **Mitigation:** Choose services with strong SLAs and backup options

### Medium Risk

### Low Risk
- **Static Site Complexity:** Current application is relatively simple to deploy
- **Mitigation:** Standard static hosting patterns are well-established

## Success Criteria

### Deployment Success
- [ ] Application deploys automatically on code changes

## Resource Requirements

### Development Time
- **Total Estimated Effort:** 8-10 developer days
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (with testing and refinement)
- **Team:** 1 DevOps engineer + 1 Frontend developer

### Infrastructure Costs
- **Hosting:** $0-20/month (Vercel/Netlify free tier to start)
- **Monitoring:** $0-50/month (Sentry free tier to start)
- **Domain:** $10-15/year

### Internal Dependencies
- Product requirements for the actual catalog features
- Design system and UI/UX specifications
- Product data source and API integration requirements

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Get OPS-49 ticket details to refine this specification
2. **Short-term:** Begin Phase 1 implementation with CI/CD setup
3. **Medium-term:** Scale infrastructure based on traffic and feature requirements
4. **Long-term:** Migrate to more sophisticated infrastructure as application grows

## Conclusion

This specification provides a comprehensive operational foundation for the Product Catalog UI application. The phased approach ensures critical infrastructure is in place while allowing for iterative improvements as the application evolves from its current "Hello World" state to a full-featured e-commerce platform.

The emphasis on modern tooling (Bun, TypeScript, Tailwind) positions the application for rapid development while the operational infrastructure ensures reliability and scalability as the product grows.
