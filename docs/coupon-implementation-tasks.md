## Quick Start Implementation (Minimum Viable Product)

If you want to implement a basic version quickly, focus on these essential tasks:

### Backend MVP (1 week)
1. Create basic Coupon entity (code, discountType, discountValue, expirationDate, isActive)
2. Implement simple CouponService.validateCoupon() method
3. Add POST /api/coupons/validate endpoint
4. Create a few test coupons in the database

### Frontend MVP (1 week)  
1. Add basic Coupon interface to types
2. Create simple CouponInput component
3. Add coupon state to CartContext with apply/remove methods
4. Update Cart component to show coupon input and applied discounts
5. Basic error handling for invalid coupons

### Testing MVP (2-3 days)
1. Basic unit tests for coupon validation
2. Integration test for coupon API
3. End-to-end test for coupon application flow

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- ✅ Coupon validation API returns correct responses
- ✅ All coupon business rules work correctly
- ✅ Database operations are performant
- ✅ 100% test coverage for coupon logic

### Phase 2 Success
