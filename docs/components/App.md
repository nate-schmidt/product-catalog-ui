# App Component

## Overview

The `App` component is the root component of the Product Catalog UI application. It serves as the main container and orchestrates the overall application layout and routing.

## Current Implementation

Currently, the App component displays a simple "Hello World" message with a placeholder for future e-commerce functionality.

## Planned Features

- Main application layout structure
- Routing setup for different pages
- Global state management integration
- Theme provider wrapper
- Error boundary implementation

## Props

The App component currently doesn't accept any props as it serves as the root component.

## Usage

```tsx
import { App } from './App';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
root.render(<App />);
```
