# Search Latency Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines strategies to achieve and maintain the sub-200ms search response time requirement for the e-commerce product catalog platform, as specified in OPS-20.

## Current State Analysis
- Target: <200ms search response time (per PRD)
- Platform: React/TypeScript frontend with Bun runtime
- Search scope: Full-text search across product names and descriptions
- Features needed: Auto-complete, multi-category filtering, price range, sorting, pagination

## Improvement Strategies

### 1. Frontend Optimizations

#### 1.1 Search Debouncing & Throttling
- Implement debouncing (300-500ms) for search input to reduce API calls
- Use throttling for auto-complete suggestions
- Cancel in-flight requests when new searches are initiated

#### 1.2 Client-Side Caching
- Implement LRU cache for recent search results
- Cache auto-complete suggestions
- Use React Query or SWR for intelligent data fetching and caching
- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern

#### 1.3 Optimistic UI Updates
- Show loading states immediately
- Pre-fetch common search queries
- Implement skeleton screens for perceived performance

#### 1.4 Virtual Scrolling
- Use react-window or react-virtualized for large result sets
- Lazy load product images
- Implement intersection observer for infinite scroll

### 2. Backend Optimizations

#### 2.1 Database Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Composite indexes for search
CREATE INDEX idx_products_search ON products USING GIN (
  to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || description)
);

-- Category and price filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_price ON products (category_id, price);

-- Sorting indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_products_created_at ON products (created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_price ON products (price);
```

#### 2.2 Search Engine Integration
- Implement Elasticsearch or Algolia for full-text search
- Benefits:
  - Sub-50ms search response times
  - Typo tolerance and fuzzy matching
  - Faceted search capabilities
  - Built-in relevance scoring

#### 2.3 Query Optimization
- Use database query plans to identify bottlenecks
- Implement query result limiting
- Use materialized views for complex aggregations
- Implement read replicas for search queries

#### 2.4 Caching Layer
- Redis for caching:
  - Popular search results
  - Category counts
  - Price range boundaries
  - Auto-complete suggestions
- Cache invalidation strategy based on product updates

### 3. API & Network Optimizations

#### 3.1 API Design
```typescript
// Optimized search endpoint
GET /api/v1/products/search
Query params:
- q: search query (required)
- category: category filter (optional)
- min_price: minimum price (optional)
- max_price: maximum price (optional)
- sort: relevance|price_asc|price_desc|date (default: relevance)
- page: page number (default: 1)
- limit: results per page (default: 20, max: 100)
```

#### 3.2 Response Optimization
- Implement field filtering to return only necessary data
- Use pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Compress API responses with gzip/brotli
- Implement HTTP/2 or HTTP/3

#### 3.3 CDN Strategy
- Cache static product images on CDN
- Implement image optimization (WebP, AVIF)
- Use responsive images with srcset

### 4. Infrastructure Optimizations

#### 4.1 Horizontal Scaling
- Deploy search service on multiple instances
- Use load balancer with health checks
- Implement auto-scaling based on response time metrics

#### 4.2 Geographic Distribution
- Deploy search infrastructure in multiple regions
- Use geo-routing for lowest latency
- Implement edge caching for popular searches

#### 4.3 Database Optimization
- Use connection pooling
- Implement query result caching at DB level
- Consider read replicas for search queries
- Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE operations

### 5. Monitoring & Performance Testing

#### 5.1 Key Metrics to Track
- P50, P95, P99 search response times
- Search query volume
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates
- Database query execution time

#### 5.2 Performance Testing Plan
```javascript
// Example k6 load test
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '2m', target: 200 },
    { duration: '5m', target: 200 },
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<200'], // 95% of requests under 200ms
  },
};

export default function() {
  let response = http.get('https://api.example.com/products/search?q=laptop');
  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 200ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 200,
  });
}
```

#### 5.3 Monitoring Tools
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM): DataDog, New Relic, or AppDynamics
- Log aggregation: ELK stack or Splunk
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) for actual user experience
- Custom dashboards for search performance

### 6. Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1-2)
1. Implement search debouncing
2. Add basic client-side caching
3. Create database indexes
4. Enable API response compression

#### Phase 2: Core Optimizations (Week 3-6)
1. Integrate Elasticsearch or similar search engine
2. Implement Redis caching layer
3. Optimize API response payloads
4. Set up monitoring and alerting

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 7-10)
1. Implement auto-complete with caching
2. Add virtual scrolling for results
3. Deploy CDN for images
4. Implement A/B testing framework

#### Phase 4: Scale & Polish (Week 11-12)
1. Load testing and optimization
2. Multi-region deployment
3. Performance documentation

## Success Criteria
- 95th percentile search response time < 200ms
- 99th percentile search response time < 500ms
- Search availability > 99.9%
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5 for search functionality

## Risk Mitigation
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Comprehensive testing environment
- Rollback procedures for each optimization
- Regular performance regression testing

## Budget Considerations
- Search engine licensing (if using managed service)
- Additional infrastructure costs (caching, CDN)
- Monitoring tool subscriptions
- Engineering time for implementation

## Conclusion
This comprehensive plan addresses search latency from multiple angles, ensuring the platform meets and exceeds the 200ms response time requirement while providing a superior user experience.
