# Components Directory

This directory is intended to house React components for the Product Catalog UI application.

## Current Status

Currently, this directory does not contain any components as the application is in its initial template state with only a basic App component located in the parent directory.

## Planned Components

Based on the project name "Product Catalog UI", this directory will likely contain:

- **ProductCard** - Individual product display component
- **ProductList** - Grid or list view of multiple products
- **SearchBar** - Product search functionality
- **FilterPanel** - Product filtering controls
- **CategoryNavigation** - Product category navigation
- **ShoppingCart** - Cart functionality components
- **ProductDetails** - Detailed product view

## Component Structure Guidelines

When adding components to this directory, follow these conventions:

### File Naming
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `ProductCard.tsx`)
- Include corresponding test files (e.g., `ProductCard.test.tsx`)
- Consider index files for complex components with multiple sub-components

### Component Organization
```
components/
├── ProductCard/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── ProductCard.tsx
│   ├── ProductCard.test.tsx
│   └── ProductCard.module.css (if needed)
├── SearchBar.tsx
├── SearchBar.test.tsx
└── README.md (this file)
```

### Documentation Standards
Each component should include:
- JSDoc comments describing purpose and props
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- Usage examples in comments
- Test coverage for key functionality

## Testing
Components should be tested using:
- Bun test runner
- Testing Library React
- Happy DOM for browser environment simulation

Follow the patterns established in `../App.test.tsx` for consistency.
