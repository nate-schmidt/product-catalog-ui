# Card Component

## Overview

The `Card` component renders an individual product card within the product catalog, displaying product information and providing interaction capabilities.

## Status

⚠️ **Documentation Pending**: The `Card.tsx` source file needs to be available in this workspace to generate complete documentation.

**File Information**: `Card.tsx` (`1.9KB`, `63` lines)

## Expected Functionality

Based on typical product card patterns and the project structure, this component likely:

- Displays product information (name, manufacturer, price)
- Renders product image or placeholder
- Provides "Add to Cart" button or similar interaction
- Shows product availability or stock status
- Handles hover/focus states for better UX
- Integrates with cart context to add items

## Expected Props

```typescript
interface CardProps {
  product: Product;  // Product object containing id, name, manufacturer, price
}
```

## Likely Dependencies

- `Product` type from `../types/cart`
- `CartContext` (via `useCart` hook) for adding items to cart
- Possibly uses `CartIcon` or similar UI elements

## Usage

Referenced in `ProductCatalog.tsx`:

```tsx
{products.map((product) => (
  <Card key={product.id} product={product} />
))}
```
