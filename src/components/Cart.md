# Cart Component

## Overview

The `Cart` component displays the shopping cart interface where users can view and manage items they've added for purchase.

## Status

⚠️ **Documentation Pending**: The `Cart.tsx` source file needs to be available in this workspace to generate complete documentation.

**File Information**: `Cart.tsx` (`6.4KB`, `178` lines)

## Expected Functionality

Based on typical e-commerce patterns and the project structure, this component likely:

- Displays all items currently in the shopping cart
- Shows product details (name, price, quantity) for each cart item
- Provides controls to update quantities or remove items
- Calculates and displays subtotal/total prices
- Offers a checkout or proceed-to-purchase action
- May include empty cart state handling

## Likely Dependencies

- `CartContext` from `../context/CartContext` for cart state management
- `Product` and `CartItem` types from `../types/cart`
- `cartStorage` utilities from `../utils/cartStorage` for persistence

## Related Components
