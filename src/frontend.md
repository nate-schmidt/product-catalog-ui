# `frontend.tsx` Entry Point

**File:** `src/frontend.tsx`

## Overview
`frontend.tsx` is the browser entry point for the React single-page application (SPA).
It is responsible for locating the root DOM element, creating a React renderer,
and mounting the root `App` component. The file is referenced by `src/index.html`
via a `<script type="module">` tag and is therefore executed in the browser
context.

## Responsibilities
1. Import and initialize the React DOM client (`createRoot`).
2. Render the `App` component once the HTML document has finished loading.
3. Provide a safe fallback for situations where the DOM is already ready
   (e.g. when using server-side rendering or strict reloads).

## Props
_None._ – This file does not define a React component that accepts props; it is
strictly an initialization script.

## Returns
`void` – Side-effects only; nothing is returned from the module other than the
browser-executed code.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Hydration Support:** Add logic to hydrate server-rendered markup when SSR
   is introduced.
2. **Error Boundaries:** Wrap `App` in a top-level error boundary to catch
   uncaught React errors.
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Integrate web-vitals or custom performance
   logging for first-contentful paint, TTI, etc.
