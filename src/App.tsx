/*
 * App Component
 * -------------
 * This is the top-level React component rendered by the application.
 *
 * Responsibilities
 * â€¢ Display a welcoming hero section that greets visitors with a heading and
 *   short subtitle.
 * â€¢ Provide a centred, responsive layout that looks good on both mobile and
 *   desktop screens.
 * â€¢ Showcase TailwindCSS utility classes in action â€“ the component itself does
 *   not hold any business logic; instead, it focuses purely on presentational
 *   concerns.
 *
 * Visual structure
 * <div> (max width container, centred)
 * â””â”€ <div> (flex column, vertically & horizontally centred)
 *    â”œâ”€ <h1> â€“ main heading
 *    â””â”€ <p> â€“ subtitle/lead paragraph
 *
 * Styling highlights
 * â€¢ max-w-7xl â€“ constrains the maximum width so the content does not stretch
 *   on large viewports.
 * â€¢ mx-auto â€“ horizontally centres the outer container.
 * â€¢ p-8 â€“ adds generous padding around the content.
 * â€¢ text-center â€“ centres text for a clean hero look.
 * â€¢ text-white / text-gray-300 â€“ provides good contrast against the dark
 *   background set globally in index.css.
 *
 * Export
 * The component is exported as a named export (`App`) and as the default export
 * so that it can be imported with either syntax:
 *   import { App } from "./App";
 *   // or
 *   import App from "./App";
