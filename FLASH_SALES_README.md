1. Add admin interface for creating flash sales
2. Connect to a real database
3. Implement inventory management
4. Add user authentication and cart functionality

### Customizing Flash Sales

To customize flash sale behavior, modify:

- **Validation rules**: Edit `src/utils/flashSaleUtils.ts`
- **UI styling**: Update component CSS classes
- **Mock data**: Modify `src/data/mockData.ts`
- **API logic**: Update endpoints in `src/index.tsx`
